        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>My Web Design and Development Background</h3>
        <p class='p'>I started programming websites as a teenager around high school age. Programming websites started as a hobby for me, but I liked it so much that I decided to attend school for it. I started learning Python initially, but switched to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript after finding out I really liked building websites. I started learning web design in 2020 and am starting to design my first few websites.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>My Education</h3>
        <p class='p'>Currently, I am attending Southern New Hampshire University for an Information Technology degree and plan to get a minor in web design. This is so I can have a formal education in designing websites too.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>My Work Experience</h3>
        <p class='p'>As of now, I am a freshman in college that is trying to study web design and development not just in college, but also on my own by getting experience building and designing websites for myself and other people. So far, I have been able to get some experience building websites for other people, but plan to get even more experience in the future. I currently, and for over a year, have been working as a paid fullstack developer apprentice that builds and customizes wordpress websites for a small startup company. I have gained invaluable skills which include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as some PHP.</p>
